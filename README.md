# pimpcloud #

This is the cloud server for the MusicPimp app. The objective is to make your music accessible even if your media server
is behind a NAT that you can't or don't want to configure. It also simplifies the initial setup on mobile devices since
you don't need to configure an IP address, but instead access your machine using its cloud ID.
